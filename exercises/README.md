# Go Tutorial Exercises

Practice exercises to reinforce concepts from each tutorial.

## Structure

Each tutorial has its own folder with multiple exercises:

```
exercises/
├── tutorial-1/          # Go Basics
│   ├── 01-hello-world/
│   ├── 02-variables/
│   ├── 03-types/
│   ├── 04-conditionals/
│   ├── 05-loops/
│   └── 06-switch/
└── ...
```

## How to Use

1. Navigate to an exercise: `cd tutorial-1/01-hello-world`
2. Read the instructions in `main.go`
3. Complete the TODO sections
4. Run: `go run main.go`
5. Compare with `solution/main.go` if stuck

## Tips

- Start with exercise 01 and work through in order
- Read error messages carefully - Go is helpful
- Use `go fmt main.go` to auto-format your code
- Experiment! Modify the code and see what happens
