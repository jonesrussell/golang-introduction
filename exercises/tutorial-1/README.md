# Tutorial 1 Exercises: Go Basics

Practice exercises for Variables, Types, and Control Flow.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to an exercise folder
2. Read the instructions in the `main.go` file
3. Complete the TODO sections
4. Run your code: `go run main.go`
5. Check against `solution/main.go` if stuck

## Exercises

| # | Exercise | Topics |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Hello World | Package basics, fmt.Println |
| 2 | Variables | var, :=, constants, zero values |
| 3 | Types | int, float64, string, type conversion |
| 4 | Conditionals | if/else, comparison operators |
| 5 | Loops | for loop, range, break/continue |
| 6 | Switch | switch statements, multiple cases |

## Running Exercises

```bash
# Run an exercise
cd 01-hello-world
go run main.go

# Run the solution
go run solution/main.go
```

## Tips

- Read error messages carefully - Go's compiler is helpful
- Unused variables cause compile errors - comment them out while testing
- Use `go fmt main.go` to format your code
