# Instructor Notes: Practical Example

## Teaching Techniques
- Build incrementally
- Show logging in action
- Demonstrate different scenarios
- Show proper configuration

## Build Order
1. Set up Zap logger
2. Configure for development/production
3. Add logging to functions
4. Show error logging with context
5. Demonstrate structured fields
6. Show how it all works together

## Live Commentary
- "Notice how we configure the logger"
- "Structured fields provide context"
- "Error logging includes stack traces"
- "This demonstrates all the patterns"

## Things to Emphasize
- Logger configuration
- Structured fields
- Error logging
- Context inclusion

## Engagement
- "What would you log here?"
- "How would you add more context?"
- Challenge: "Add request tracing"

## Variations to Mention
- Could add more context fields
- Could add log sampling
- Could add different outputs
- Could add log rotation
