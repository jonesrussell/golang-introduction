# Instructor Notes: Introduction

## Teaching Techniques
- Contrast with exception-based languages
- Show enthusiasm for Go's explicit error handling
- Emphasize: "Errors are values, not exceptions"
- Preview the file processor example

## Key Points to Emphasize
- Errors are explicit and handled at each step
- Error handling is part of normal control flow
- Makes code more predictable and easier to debug
- Encourages thinking about failure cases upfront

## Engagement
- Ask: "Have you used try/catch in other languages?"
- Mention: "Go's approach makes errors visible - no hidden exceptions"
- Promise: "You'll build a robust file processor with comprehensive error handling"

## Real-World Context
- Every Go function that can fail returns an error
- Error handling is everywhere in Go codebases
- This approach prevents many bugs

## Transition
- "Let's start by understanding the error interface..."
