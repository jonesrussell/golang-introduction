# Instructor Notes: Introduction

## Teaching Techniques
- Show enthusiasm for interfaces - "Go's killer feature"
- Contrast with explicit implementation in other languages
- Preview the plugin system example to build excitement
- Emphasize: "Interfaces enable polymorphism without inheritance"

## Key Points to Emphasize
- Interfaces define behavior, not data
- Implicit implementation (no `implements` keyword!)
- Enables polymorphism and decoupling
- Foundation for testable, maintainable code

## Engagement
- Ask: "Have you used interfaces in Java or C#?"
- Mention: "Go's interfaces are different - implicit and powerful"
- Promise: "You'll build a plugin system that accepts any notifier"

## Real-World Context
- Interfaces used everywhere in Go codebases
- Standard library built on small interfaces
- Foundation for dependency injection and testing

## Transition
- "Let's start by understanding what interfaces are..."
