## Teaching Techniques
- Build incrementally
- Show complete project structure
- Demonstrate all concepts
- Show proper organization

## Build Order
1. Create module
2. Set up project layout
3. Create packages
4. Show visibility
5. Add dependencies
6. Show how it all works together

## Live Commentary
- "Notice how we organize the project"
- "Packages group related functionality"
- "Module manages dependencies"
- "This demonstrates all the patterns"

## Things to Emphasize
- Project layout
- Package organization
- Visibility rules
- Module management

## Engagement
- "What would you organize differently?"
- "How would you structure this?"
- Challenge: "Add more packages"

## Variations to Mention
- Could add more packages
- Could add more dependencies
- Could add tests
- Could add documentation
