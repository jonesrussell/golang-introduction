# Instructor Notes: Common Patterns

## Teaching Techniques
- Show common patterns
- Demonstrate standard practices
- Show what works well
- Emphasize: "Patterns make code familiar"

## Key Patterns
- cmd/ for main applications
- internal/ for private code
- pkg/ for public libraries
- Standard directory structure

## Key Emphasis
- **Standard layout**: Follow conventions
- **Patterns**: Use established patterns
- **Familiarity**: Makes code easier to understand
- **Best practices**: Learn from the community

## Common Questions
- "What patterns should I use?" - Standard project layout
- "Where do I put main?" - cmd/ directory
- "What about tests?" - Same package, _test.go files

## Engagement
- "Notice how these patterns are standard"
- "Following patterns makes code familiar"
- "This is how Go projects are organized"

## Real-World Context
- These patterns are standard
- Used in many Go projects
- Makes code familiar

## Transition
- "Let's wrap up..."
