# Instructor Notes: Visibility Rules

## Teaching Techniques
- Show export rules
- Demonstrate capitalized vs lowercase
- Show package-level visibility
- Emphasize: "Capitalization controls visibility"

## Key Emphasis
- **Exported**: Capitalized names (public)
- **Unexported**: Lowercase names (private)
- **Package-level**: Visible within package
- **Simple rule**: Capitalize to export

## Common Questions
- "How do I export something?" - Capitalize the name
- "What's visible where?" - Exported = public, unexported = package-private
- "Is it that simple?" - Yes!

## Engagement
- "Notice how simple this is"
- "Capitalization controls visibility"
- "This is the Go way"

## Real-World Context
- Visibility is simple in Go
- Capitalization is the rule
- Used everywhere

## Transition
