# Instructor Notes: Hello World & Package Basics

## Teaching Techniques
- Type code live (don't copy/paste) - shows thinking process
- Run code frequently to show output
- Intentionally make a small typo and fix it

## Demo Flow
1. Create new file `main.go`
2. Type `package main` - explain packages
3. Add import - explain what fmt does
4. Write func main() - explain entry point
5. Run with `go run main.go`

## Common Questions to Address
- "Why package main?" - It's the entry point for executables
- "What's fmt?" - Format package for I/O
- "Can I name main.go something else?" - Yes, but main.go is convention

## Engagement
- Ask: "What do you think this will print?"
- Pause and let viewers type along
- Show error message if you forget something

## Gotchas to Demonstrate
- Missing import shows helpful error
- Wrong package name shows error
- Missing func main shows error
