# Instructor Notes: Practical Example

## Teaching Techniques
- Build incrementally
- Show slice and map usage
- Demonstrate patterns
- Show proper initialization

## Build Order
1. Define data structures
2. Create store with maps
3. Add slice operations
4. Show proper initialization
5. Demonstrate patterns
6. Show error handling

## Live Commentary
- "Notice how we use maps for lookups"
- "Slices for ordered collections"
- "Pre-allocation helps performance"
- "This demonstrates all the patterns we learned"

## Things to Emphasize
- Map usage for key-value storage
- Slice usage for ordered data
- Proper initialization
- Pattern application

## Engagement
- "What patterns do you see here?"
- "How would you optimize this?"
- Challenge: "Add indexing for faster lookups"

## Variations to Mention
- Could add more data structures
- Could add caching
- Could add persistence
- Could add transactions
