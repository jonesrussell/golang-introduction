# Instructor Notes: Wrap Up

## Recap What Was Covered
- Arrays (fixed-size, value types)
- Slices (dynamic, reference types, internals)
- Maps (key-value stores, patterns)
- Performance considerations
- Common pitfalls

## Key Takeaways to Emphasize
- Slices are Go's workhorse
- Understanding internals prevents bugs
- Maps are versatile data structures
- Pre-allocation matters for performance

## Preview Next Tutorial
- "Next: Dependency Injection - writing testable code"
- "You'll learn how to structure code for testing"
- "We'll build on everything you learned today"

## Practice Recommendations
- **Easy**: Implement a simple cache
- **Medium**: Build a frequency counter
- **Challenge**: Implement a ring buffer

## Cheat Sheet Highlights
- Array: `[5]int`
- Slice: `[]int`, `make([]int, len, cap)`
- Map: `map[string]int`, `make(map[string]int)`
- Append: `append(slice, item)`
- Copy: `copy(dst, src)`

## Engagement
- "What was the most surprising thing about slices?"
- "Try building something with slices and maps"
- "Questions? Let's address them now"

## Closing
- "You've mastered Go's collection types"
- "Slices and maps are everywhere in Go code"
- "Next tutorial: Dependency Injection - see you there!"
