# Instructor Notes: Introduction

## Teaching Techniques
- Emphasize why understanding internals matters
- Contrast arrays, slices, and maps
- Show enthusiasm for Go's collection types
- Preview the in-memory database example

## Key Points to Emphasize
- Arrays are fixed-size, value types (rarely used)
- Slices are dynamic, reference types (most common)
- Maps are key-value stores (very common)
- Understanding internals prevents bugs

## Engagement
- Ask: "Have you used arrays in other languages?"
- Mention: "Slices are Go's workhorse - you'll use them constantly"
- Promise: "You'll build an in-memory database"

## Real-World Context
- Slices used everywhere in Go code
- Understanding internals prevents common bugs
- Maps are essential for many data structures

## Transition
- "Let's start with arrays - the foundation..."
