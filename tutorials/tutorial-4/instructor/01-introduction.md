# Instructor Notes: Introduction

## Teaching Techniques
- Address common confusion upfront
- Show enthusiasm for Go's pointer safety
- Preview the final example (linked list) to build excitement
- Emphasize: "Pointers are simpler in Go than C/C++"

## Key Points to Emphasize
- Pointers enable indirect access to memory
- Essential for modifying data and efficiency
- Go makes pointers safer (no pointer arithmetic, garbage collection)
- Understanding pointers is crucial for efficient Go code

## Engagement
- Ask: "Have you used pointers in C or C++?"
- Mention: "Go's pointers are safer - no memory leaks, no pointer arithmetic"
- Promise: "You'll build a linked list by the end"

## Real-World Context
- Pointers used everywhere in Go codebases
- Essential for methods that modify state
- Foundation for interfaces and concurrency

## Transition
- "Let's start with the basics: what are pointers?"
