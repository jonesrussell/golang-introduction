# Instructor Notes: Subcommands

## Teaching Techniques
- Show subcommand structure
- Demonstrate nested commands
- Show how to organize
- Emphasize: "Subcommands organize complex tools"

## Key Emphasis
- **Subcommands**: Nested commands
- **Organization**: Group related commands
- **Structure**: Root -> subcommands -> sub-subcommands
- **Flexibility**: Each command has its own flags

## Common Questions
- "How do I create subcommands?" - Add commands to parent
- "How deep can I nest?" - As deep as needed
- "Can subcommands have flags?" - Yes, each command has its own

## Engagement
- "Notice how subcommands organize the tool"
- "Each command is independent"
- "This makes complex tools manageable"

## Real-World Context
- Subcommands are common in complex tools
- kubectl, docker use this pattern
- Makes tools more organized

## Transition
- "Let's see configuration with Viper..."
