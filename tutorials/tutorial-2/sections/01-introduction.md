# Introduction

**Duration:** 2-3 minutes

## Topics to cover:
- Welcome and what viewers will learn
- Why structs? (Organizing related data, modeling real-world entities)
- Comparison to other languages: structs vs classes
- Go philosophy: [composition over inheritance](https://go.dev/doc/faq#inheritance)
- Show the final example: Building a User management system

## Key teaching points:
- [Structs](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Struct_types) are Go's primary way to create custom data types
- They group related data together
- Go uses [composition instead of inheritance](https://go.dev/doc/faq#inheritance)
- Structs are [value types](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Types) by default
