# Instructor Notes: Wrap Up

## Recap What Was Covered
- Struct definition and initialization
- Field access and modification
- Methods with value and pointer receivers
- Best practices and common mistakes
- When to use structs vs other types

## Key Takeaways to Emphasize
- Structs are Go's primary data organization tool
- Pointer receivers for modification, value receivers for reading
- Constructor pattern ensures valid state
- Consistency matters (receiver types, initialization style)
