# Instructor Notes: Introduction

## Teaching Techniques
- Compare structs to classes in other languages (but emphasize they're simpler)
- Show enthusiasm for Go's composition-over-inheritance philosophy
- Preview the final example to build excitement

## Key Points to Emphasize
- Structs are Go's primary way to create custom types
- They group related data together (like a "data container")
- Go uses composition instead of inheritance
- Structs are value types by default (important for later!)

## Engagement
- Ask: "Have you used classes in other languages?"
- Mention: "Structs are simpler - no inheritance, no constructors by default"
- Promise: "By the end, you'll build a complete User management system"

## Real-World Context
- Structs model real-world entities (User, Product, Order)
- Used everywhere in Go codebases
- Foundation for methods (next tutorial)

## Transition
- "Let's start by understanding what structs are and why we need them"
