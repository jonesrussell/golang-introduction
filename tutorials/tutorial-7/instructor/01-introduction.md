# Instructor Notes: Introduction

## Teaching Techniques
- Show enthusiasm for Go's concurrency model
- Contrast with thread-based concurrency
- Explain the philosophy: "Don't communicate by sharing memory"
- Preview the web scraper example

## Key Points to Emphasize
- Concurrency vs parallelism (dealing with vs doing)
- Goroutines are lightweight (2KB stack)
- Channels provide safe communication
- Go's approach is simpler than threads

## Engagement
- Ask: "Have you used threads in other languages?"
- Mention: "Goroutines are much lighter than threads"
- Promise: "You'll build a concurrent web scraper"

## Real-World Context
- Go's concurrency is one of its strongest features
- Used extensively in production systems
- Foundation for scalable applications

## Transition
- "Let's start with goroutines - Go's lightweight threads"
