# Instructor Notes: Introduction

## Teaching Techniques
- Contrast with inheritance-based languages (Java, Python)
- Show enthusiasm for Go's simpler approach
- Preview the final example to build excitement
- Emphasize: "Go chose simplicity over power"

## Key Points to Emphasize
- Go has NO class inheritance (intentional design)
- Composition and embedding provide code reuse
- This avoids tight coupling from inheritance
- Embedding is Go's elegant solution

## Engagement
- Ask: "Have you used inheritance in other languages?"
- Mention: "Inheritance creates tight coupling - Go avoids this"
- Promise: "You'll build an employee management system"

## Real-World Context
- Many Go codebases use embedding extensively
- Standard library uses it (io.Reader, io.Writer)
- Foundation for interfaces (tutorial 5)

## Transition
- "Let's see what problem we're solving"
