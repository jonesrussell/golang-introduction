# Introduction

**Duration:** 3-4 minutes

## Topics to cover:
- Welcome and what viewers will learn
- Why composition over inheritance?
- Go's philosophy: ["favor composition over inheritance"](https://go.dev/doc/faq#inheritance)
- Comparison: How other languages do it (Java/Python classes vs Go structs)
- Show the final example: Building an employee management system
- Preview: How embedding provides code reuse without inheritance complexity

## Key teaching points:
- Go has [no class inheritance](https://go.dev/doc/faq#inheritance)
- [Composition and embedding](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Struct_types) provide code reuse
- This is intentional design - [inheritance creates tight coupling](https://go.dev/doc/faq#inheritance)
- [Embedding](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Struct_types) is Go's answer to code reuse
