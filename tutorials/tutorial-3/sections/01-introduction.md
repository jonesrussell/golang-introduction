# Introduction

**Duration:** 3-4 minutes

## Topics to cover:
- Welcome and what viewers will learn
- Why composition over inheritance?
- Go's philosophy: "favor composition over inheritance"
- Comparison: How other languages do it (Java/Python classes vs Go structs)
- Show the final example: Building an employee management system
- Preview: How embedding provides code reuse without inheritance complexity

## Key teaching points:
- Go has no class inheritance
- Composition and embedding provide code reuse
- This is intentional design - inheritance creates tight coupling
- Embedding is Go's answer to code reuse
