# Instructor Notes: Introduction

## Teaching Techniques
- Show enthusiasm for testable code
- Contrast tight coupling vs loose coupling
- Emphasize: "DI makes code testable and maintainable"
- Preview the user service example

## Key Points to Emphasize
- Dependency injection enables testing
- Go uses interfaces for DI
- Constructor injection is common pattern
- DI improves maintainability

## Engagement
- Ask: "Have you struggled to test code with dependencies?"
- Mention: "DI makes testing easy"
- Promise: "You'll build a testable user service"

## Real-World Context
- DI used extensively in production code
- Essential for testable code
- Standard pattern in Go

## Transition
- "Let's see what tight coupling looks like..."
