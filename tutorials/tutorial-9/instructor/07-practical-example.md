# Instructor Notes: Practical Example

## Teaching Techniques
- Build incrementally
- Show DI in action
- Demonstrate testing
- Show all patterns together

## Build Order
1. Define interfaces
2. Create concrete implementations
3. Build service with DI
4. Show testing with mocks
5. Demonstrate functional options
6. Show how it all works together

## Live Commentary
- "Notice how we define interfaces first"
- "Dependencies are injected in constructor"
- "Testing is easy with mocks"
- "This demonstrates all the patterns"

## Things to Emphasize
- Interface design
- Constructor injection
- Testing with mocks
- Functional options

## Engagement
- "What patterns do you see here?"
- "How would you test this?"
- Challenge: "Add another dependency"

## Variations to Mention
- Could add more dependencies
- Could add more options
- Could add middleware
- Could add validation
