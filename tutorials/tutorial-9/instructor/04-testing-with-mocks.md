# Instructor Notes: Testing with Mocks

## Teaching Techniques
- Show how to create mocks
- Demonstrate testing with mocks
- Show table-driven tests
- Emphasize: "Mocks make testing easy"

## Key Emphasis
- **Mocks**: Implement interfaces for testing
- **Easy to create**: Just implement the interface
- **Table-driven tests**: Test multiple scenarios
- **Isolation**: Test unit in isolation

## Common Questions
- "How do I create mocks?" - Implement the interface
- "Do I need a mocking library?" - No, simple structs work
- "How do I test error cases?" - Return errors from mock

## Engagement
- "Notice how easy it is to test now"
- "We can test error cases easily"
- "Mocks are just simple structs"

## Real-World Context
- Mocks used extensively in testing
- Essential for unit testing
- Simple in Go (no libraries needed)

## Transition
- "Let's see how to design good interfaces..."
