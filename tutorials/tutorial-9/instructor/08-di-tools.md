# Instructor Notes: DI Tools

## Teaching Techniques
- Show when tools are useful
- Demonstrate wire (code generation)
- Show when not to use tools
- Emphasize: "Tools are optional, patterns are essential"

## Key Emphasis
- **Wire**: Code generation for DI
- **When to use**: Complex dependency graphs
- **When not to use**: Simple cases (manual is fine)
- **Patterns first**: Understand patterns before tools

## Common Questions
- "Do I need a DI framework?" - No, manual is fine
- "When do I use wire?" - Complex dependency graphs
- "Is it worth it?" - Depends on complexity

## Engagement
- "Tools are optional - patterns are essential"
- "Start with manual DI, add tools if needed"
- "Wire generates code, doesn't change patterns"

## Real-World Context
- Most Go code uses manual DI
- Wire is useful for complex cases
- Patterns matter more than tools

## Transition
- "Let's see best practices..."
